    @brief
        The ADAPTER is an architecture specific package implemented to support the common WINC driver. When
        porting the driver to a new architecture this package will need to be written to provide the
        functionality described here.

 @fn \
    int_fast8_t winc_adapter_init(void);

 @brief
    This function is used to initialize the ADAPTER in order to prepare the WINC before any
    WINC API calls.

 @details
    The winc_adapter_init function is the first function that should be called at the beginning of
    every application to initialize the ADAPTER and the WINC board. Otherwise, the rest of the ADAPTER
    function calls will return with failure. This function should also be called after the WINC
    has been switched off with a successful call to @ref winc_adapter_deinit in order to reinitialize
    the ADAPTER before the Application can use any of the WINC APIs again. After the function
    initializes the WINC.

@note
    Implementation of this function is host dependent.

@warning
    Omitting this function will lead to unavailability of host-chip communication.

@see    winc_adapter_deinit

@return
    The function returns a value of 1 for successful operations and a 0 value otherwise.

/*!
@fn \
    int_fast8_t winc_adapter_deinit(void);

@brief
    This function is used to de-initialize the ADAPTER and turn off the WINC board.

@details
    The winc_adapter_deinit is the last function that should be called after the application has
    finished and before the WINC is switched off. Every function call of @ref winc_adapter_init
    should be matched with a call to winc_adapter_deinit. Failure to do so may result in the WINC
    consuming higher power than expected, since it won't be properly de-initialized.

@pre
    The ADAPTER should be initialized through @ref winc_adapter_init first.

@note
    Implementation of this function is host dependent.

@warning
    Omitting this function may lead to unknown behavior in case of soft reset.

    The function returns a value of 1 for successful operations and a 0 value otherwise.

    to WINC board events. It is important to be considerate while choosing the sleep period.

@fn \
    int_fast8_t winc_adapter_interrupt_serviced(bool bEdgeInt);

@brief
    Indicates to the ADAPTER that a pending interrupt has been processed by the driver. The WINC driver
    will call this function to indicate that a message has been received from the WINC. @p bEdgeInt
    indicates if an edge interrupt should be serviced (true) or a level interrupt (false).

    If the ADAPTER is managing the WINC devices IRQn line as an edge interrupt then when @p bEdgeInt is true
    the ADAPTER should consider a pending interrupt has been serviced. If @p bEdgeInt is false the ADAPTER must
    ignore it. This ensures the interrupt is serviced before the WINC re-activates the IRQn line and thus
    before another interrupt can be received.

    If the ADAPTER is managing the WINC devices IRQn line as a level interrupt then when @p bEdgeInt is false
    the ADAPTER should consider a pending interrupt has been serviced. If @p bEdgeInt is true the ADAPTER must
    ignore it. This ensures the interrupt is serviced after the WINC re-activates the IRQn line and thus
    ensures any previous interrupt level has been de-asserted by the WINC.

@pre
    Initialize @ref winc_adapter_init first.

@note
    Implementation of this function is host dependent.
